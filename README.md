# RiderLauncher
Allows you to associate .SLN files with RiderLauncher to retain the Rider icon and can always launch the latest Toolbox version that is installed. Tested on Windows and Linux.<br>

With Linux you have to go to your settings, it may be under 'Application' > 'File Associations' and click 'Add'.<br>
For the 'Group' selection 'application' and 'Type Name' it will be '*.sln' then under general change the icon to the included 'Rider.svg'.<br>
Click 'Apply' then go to an '.sln' file and right click and assign it to 'Remember application association' then select your recently built Rider binary.
